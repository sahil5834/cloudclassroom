1.1	Purpose

The Software Requirements Specification (SRS)  will  provide  a  detailed description of requirements for the The Cloud Class. This SRS will be helpful for complete understanding what is to be expected from the newly introduced system which is to be constructed. The clear understanding of the system and its functionality will allow for the correct software to be developed  for the end user and will be used for the development of the future stages of the project.This SRS will provide the foundation of the project. From this SRS, the Hostel Management System can be designed, constructed and finally tested.
The Project team will use the SRS to fully understand the expectations  of the HMS to construct the appropriate software. The hostel end users will be able to use the SRS as a “test” to see if the constructing team will be constructing the system to their expectations.


1.2	Objective

•	To deal with The Cloud Class in an easy and an efficient manner.
•	Create strong and secrete database that allow for any connection  in  a secret way, to prevent any outside or inside attacks.


1.3	Scope of the Project

The “Cloud Classrooms” Website (web based application) is useful for the students, faculty, guest whomever likes to learn from web using E-Learn (Videos), as well Check result, schedules of assessment and all that task like event, news, students can find out list of fresh courses offered by them and admission procedure, discussion forum, fee structure etc. without going to institute. It provides the facility to the students or guest to have complete information about the institute. In this application, student can attend his\her missed classes from e-learn.








Overview of Project
The Cloud Class is a web application which aims at computerization of current procedure of allocating hostel rooms. Currently the process involves students filling up the forms and submitting them in respective hostel offices which involves a lot of paperwork, hence less efficient.


2.	Overall Description
2.1	System Requirement
The Web Application has two main parts:
1)	Administrators
2)	Students
3)	Faculty
The student can select among the allocated hostel to a specified batch and the Hostel Administrator can assign the room number in the specific hostel that the student has selected upon the availability.


3.	User Requirements Definition
The user requirement for this system is to make the system fast, flexible, less prone to error, reduce expenses and save the time.
1.	Less human error
2.	Strength and strain of manual labor can be reduced
3.	High security
4.	Data redundancy can be avoided to some extent
 
5.	Data consistency
6.	Easy to handle
7.	Easy data updating
8.	Easy record keeping
9.	Backup data can be easily generated.


4.	System Requirement Specification
4.1	Functional System Requirement

This section gives a functional requirement that applicable to the HMS. These are sub modules in this phase.
•	Administrator module.
•	User Module
•	Application Module


The functionality of each module is as follows:

•	Administrator module:
The Administrator can
1.	Allot different students to the different hostels.
2.	Vacate the students from the hostels.
3.	Edit the details of the students & modify the student records.



•	User module:
1.	Can submit the application form
2.	Can view the notice board
3.	Can submit the vacating form.
 
•	Application module:
This section provides a form to the students which can be filled by them, and a copy of the filled page can be taken in the printed form. This is later submitted to the Hostel authorities can be verified by them before allotting them to the respective hostels Rooms.


4.2	Non-Functional System Requirements:

4.2.1	Performance Requirements
Some Performance requirements identified is listed below:
1.	The database shall be able to accommodate around thousand records to store.
2.	The software shall support use of multiple users at a time.


4.2.2	Safety Requirements
The database may get crashed at any certain time due to virus or operating system failure. Therefore, it is required to take the database Backup.

4.2.3	Security Requirements
Some of the factors that are identified to protect the software from accidental or malicious access, use, modification, destruction, or disclosure are described below. Keep specific log or history data sets
1.	Assign certain functions to different modules
2.	Restrict communications between some areas of the program
3.	Check data integrity for critical variables
4.	Later version of the software will incorporate encryption
 
5.	techniques in the user/license authentication process.



5.	Hardware Requirements

•	Processor: Pentium or greater
•	RAM: 512MB
•	Hard Disk: Depends on how much data is stored in DATABASE (min 1GB)
•	Keyboard
•	Monitor


6.	Software Requirements

•	OS: Linux
•	Database: SQL
 
Conclusion

This Cloud class can be very helpful to both hostel administration and student,faculty. They both can get information through a single click. This HMS helps hostel administration to track all data records of student that are residing in hostel. During this covid period none have to visit any office to get any information or to complain about anything as we are providing here message box for communication.


It will provide transparency and occupancy of cloud class rooms.


Through this platform each student can easily know about its cloud class availability status none of them has to make phone calls to college authority as all information is live on the website.
